# Options SaaS — Architecture Review & Production Roadmap

**Reviewed:** develop branch (repomix export, June 2026)  
**Reviewer:** Claude (Anthropic) — Software Architect perspective  
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for Claude Code-assisted development  
**Last updated:** June 2026 — all pre-launch and important issues resolved; production live.

---

## Project State Summary

A full-stack SaaS for U.S. equity options analytics. FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis backend, React (Vite) + TypeScript frontend, Docker-based deployment on Hetzner, production live at optionstacker.com.

**Stages completed through Stage 4:**
- JWT auth with httpOnly refresh-token cookie rotation
- Password reset and email verification (hashed one-time tokens)
- Saved screeners, watchlist, dashboard
- Advanced filtering and sorting (Stage 5.1 filters complete on backend)
- Ingestion-freshness observability (`/ingestion-status`, `IngestionStatusBanner`)
- CI with real Postgres + Redis service containers, actual test suite
- Sentry, Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging
- Staging environment with smoke-test runbook

---

## What Is Already Solid (Do Not Rework Pre-Launch)

- Refresh-token rotation: hashed tokens, jti tracking, revocation, replay protection
- Password reset / email verification: single-use tokens hashed with `secrets.token_urlsafe`
- Rate limiting: per-endpoint policies (`5/min` login, `3/min` register, etc.)
- Watchlist: unique constraint on `(user_id, strategy_type, contract)`, always scoped to user
- Saved screeners: always filtered by `user_id`, conflict-safe upsert
- Sorting: allowlisted via a dict-lookup pattern — not raw string interpolation, so no SQL injection risk
- Security validators: pydantic validators enforce strong `SECRET_KEY`, `REFRESH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, `HTTPS` FRONTEND_URL in production; `validate_security_settings()` is called at app startup
- CI: full real migrations + pytest run; no more `pytest || true`
- In-memory access token: frontend uses `tokenStore.ts` (module-level variable, not `localStorage`); single-flight refresh promise prevents thundering herd on 401

## Issues To Fix Before Going Live

### 🔴 CRITICAL — LAUNCH BLOCKERS

---

#### ~~1. No HTTPS / TLS anywhere~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** Caddy reverse proxy added to production stack. Handles Let's Encrypt TLS automatically. HTTP→HTTPS redirect in place via `www` → apex redirect. Nginx no longer exposes ports directly.

---

#### ~~2. DATABASE_URL_ADMIN and DATABASE_URL_APP use identical credentials everywhere~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` removed entirely. Single `DATABASE_URL_APP` used for both migrations (Alembic) and runtime. Removed from all env examples, CI, deploy workflows, `config.py`, `entrypoint.sh`, and `seed.py`.

---

#### ~~3. No automated database backups~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `scripts/backup-db.sh` runs daily at 02:00 UTC via cron on the production server. Backups stored at `~/options-saas/backups/`, compressed with gzip, 30-day retention. Logs at `~/options-saas/backups/backup.log`.

---

#### ~~4. Ingestion is still 100% manual (no scheduler)~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `scripts/prod-ingest.sh` runs the three ingestion commands (`covered_calls`, `put_options`, `spread_options`) daily at 22:00 UTC via cron on the production server. Logs at `~/options-saas/logs/ingestion.log`. Data upload from local scanner still requires a manual SCP step before the cron fires.

---

#### ~~5. `/docs` and `/openapi.json` are publicly proxied with no decision~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** Both `location /docs` and `location /openapi.json` blocks removed from `frontend/nginx.conf`. Requests fall through to the React SPA — effectively a 404 for API clients.

---

### 🟡 IMPORTANT — Fix within 2 weeks of launch

---

#### ~~6. `v2` API is dead code, still mounted in production~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `backend/app/api/v2/` directory deleted. `v2_router` import and `include_router` call removed from `bootstrap.py`.

---

#### ~~7. Prometheus metrics endpoint is publicly accessible~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `location = /v1/internal/metrics` block added to `frontend/nginx.conf` returning 403 before the request reaches the backend. Uses exact match (`=`) to take precedence over the `/v1/` prefix block.

---

#### ~~8. CORS `allow_headers=["*"]` is broader than necessary~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `allow_headers` in `bootstrap.py` tightened to `["Authorization", "Content-Type", "X-Request-ID"]` — the only three headers the frontend actually sends.

---

#### ~~9. Silent Redis fallback hides outages~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** `startup_cache()` now calls `logger.critical(...)` before falling back to `InMemoryBackend`, making Redis unavailability visible in logs and Sentry.

---

#### ~~10. `on_event("startup")` is deprecated~~ ✅ Fixed

**Fixed:** Both `@app.on_event("startup")` handlers consolidated into a single `@asynccontextmanager async def lifespan(app)` and passed to `FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)`.

---

## Issues To Fix After Launch (Stage 5 Prep)

### 🟠 ARCHITECTURE — Fix before Stage 5.1 filtering grows further

---

#### 11. Service-layer duplication — three copies of the same filter/sort logic

**Location:** `backend/app/services/covered_calls.py`, `put_options.py`, `spread_options.py`  
**What:** Each service is ~150+ lines of nearly identical range-filter and sort logic. Every new filter added in Stage 5 must be hand-copied three times. `_apply_min_filter` and `_apply_max_filter` are defined separately in each file.

**Why fix it now:** Stage 5.1 plans to add more advanced filters. Doing that before this refactor will triple the duplication again.

**Recommended fix:** Extract a shared `OptionsQueryBuilder`:
```python
# backend/app/services/query_builder.py
from typing import TypeVar, Type
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session, Query

T = TypeVar("T")

class OptionsQueryBuilder:
    def __init__(self, db: Session, model: Type[T]):
        self.query: Query = db.query(model)
        self.model = model

    def filter_eq(self, column, value):
        if value is not None:
            self.query = self.query.filter(column == value)
        return self

    def filter_range(self, column, min_val=None, max_val=None):
        if min_val is not None:
            self.query = self.query.filter(column >= min_val)
        if max_val is not None:
            self.query = self.query.filter(column <= max_val)
        return self

    def sort(self, sort_fields: dict, sort_by, sort_dir, default_order):
        if sort_by and sort_by in sort_fields:
            col = sort_fields[sort_by]
            order = col.asc() if sort_dir == "asc" else col.desc()
            self.query = self.query.order_by(order)
        else:
            self.query = self.query.order_by(*default_order)
        return self

    def paginate(self, offset: int, limit: int):
        return self.query.offset(offset).limit(limit).all()
```

---

#### 12. Exchange list hardcoded in frontend

**Location:** `frontend/src/constants/exchanges.ts`  
**What:** `NYSE=0, NASDAQ=1, ARCA=2` are hardcoded as a static TypeScript array, duplicating the `EXCHANGE` database table. The backend already has the data and the seed script.

**Fix:** Add a `/v1/exchanges` endpoint (no auth required, cacheable), replace the frontend constant with a `useExchanges()` query hook.

---

#### 13. API responses lack total-count pagination metadata

**Location:** All three strategy-list endpoints, `backend/app/services/`  
**What:** List endpoints return data arrays but no `total` row count, so the frontend cannot build "Page X of Y" UI or know if there are more pages beyond the current `limit`.

**Fix:** Add a `count()` query alongside the data query and return it in `PaginationMeta`:
```python
# In each service, alongside the .all() call:
total = query.count()
data = query.offset(offset).limit(limit).all()
# Return both; update PaginationMeta in response envelope
```

The `PaginationMeta` model already exists in `backend/app/schemas/api.py` — it just isn't populated yet.

---

#### 14. `_parse_date` defined separately in every service file

**Location:** `services/covered_calls.py`, `put_options.py`, `spread_options.py`, `ingestion/base.py`  
**What:** `_parse_date` / `parse_date` is defined at least 4 times across the codebase.

**Fix:** Move to `app/core/utils.py` or `app/core/dates.py` and import from there.

---

#### 15. No email sending implementation

**Location:** `backend/app/api/v1/auth.py` — `register`, `forgot_password`, `resend_verification`  
**What:** These endpoints generate verification/reset links but only `log` them (`log_email_link` writes the URL to the application logs). No email is actually sent. This is fine for development but means the entire password reset and email verification flow is broken for real users in production.

**Fix:** Integrate a transactional email provider before launch if you intend to use email verification/reset. Options: SendGrid, Resend, Mailgun, AWS SES. Create an `email_service.py` abstraction and call it from the auth endpoints.

Example abstraction:
```python
# backend/app/services/email_service.py
async def send_verification_email(to_email: str, link: str) -> None: ...
async def send_password_reset_email(to_email: str, link: str) -> None: ...
```

> ⚠️ **This may be a launch blocker depending on your registration model.** If users register themselves and must verify email before accessing the app, and no emails are sent, registration is effectively broken. If you're manually managing users for now (no self-registration), it's not blocking.

## Stage 5 Recommended Work Order

1. **Refactor service layer** (issue #11) — do this *before* adding more filters
2. **Add total-count pagination** (issue #13) — unblocks frontend pagination UI
3. **Add email sending** (issue #15) — required for real self-service signups
4. **Advanced filtering UI** (Stage 5.1) — backend already done; build frontend
5. **Metric glossary / tooltips** (Stage 5.2) — low-risk, can ship anytime
6. **Exchange endpoint** (issue #12) — small cleanup, do during 5.1 or 5.2
7. **Ingestion automation hardening** (Stage 5.3) — go beyond cron (scheduled workflow or Celery Beat)
8. **Data-contract hardening** (Stage 5.3) — generate Pydantic + TS types from one canonical source to prevent field drift
9. **E2E test coverage** (Stage 5.4) — add Playwright for login → screener → watchlist → dashboard smoke flow

## Notes for Claude Code Usage

When working with Claude Code on this project, provide this context at the start of sessions:

- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (sync), Pydantic v1 (`orm_mode`, `BaseSettings`), Alembic migrations, pytest
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript strict mode, TanStack Query v5, React Router v7
- **Auth:** Access token in memory (`tokenStore.ts`), refresh token in httpOnly cookie at `/v1/auth/refresh`
- **API envelope:** All responses use `ApiResponse[T]` — `{success, data, error, meta}`
- **Rate limiting:** SlowAPI — use `@limiter.limit(...)` decorator on all public endpoints
- **Caching:** `@cache(expire=30, key_builder=cache_key_builder, namespace="v1:...")` on list endpoints
- **Error handling:** Raise `AppException(code=ErrorCode.X, message="...", status_code=N)` — never raise bare HTTPException
- **Migrations:** Always create an Alembic migration for schema changes — never use `create_all()` in production
- **Naming:** Follow `options-contract-fields.md` exactly — `days_to_expiration` not `dte`, `impl_volatility` not `iv`, etc.
- **Ingestion:** JSON files land in `shared/data/`, ingested via `python -m ingestion.<strategy>` inside the backend container
